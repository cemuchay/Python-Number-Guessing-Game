A very simple number guessing game for python begineers.

How it works:

You select a lower and upper bound (which becomes the range for the guess)

A pseudo random integer is generated between the lower and upper bounds

Using a log function based on your range, a value for the number of attempts is calculated

for every incorrect guess till your number of attempts are exhausted, you get a hint on whether the number is higher or lower than the pseudo random number.
